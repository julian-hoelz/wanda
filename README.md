## Description

As the first final project exercise in my training, I developed this German web application for my training group. My fellow trainees and I can create our training records in it, and my instructor can accept or reject them. The name Wanda stands for “**W**eb**an**wendung für **d**igitale **A**usbildungsnachweise” (Web Application for Digital Training Records).
